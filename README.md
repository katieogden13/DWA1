With all of the negative news, information and media we see going on in the world it makes it difficult to focus on the 
positive side of things. The concept behind the plugin extension is to change the attitude within web sources and new 
articles by drawing the users focus to the positive words rather than focusing on the negative ones. By highlighting, 
and changing the font size, and typeface, I made a list of positive words that will stand out amongst any if not most 
web pages. This allows the users focus to be drawn to these positive aspects immediately. Providing a more beneficial 
outlook on the world and media that will hopefully cause effect from the inside out. The words I chose to use within this 
assignment were words that all add positive connotations no matter the circumstance. While the main concept around the 
extension was surrounding the idea of covid19 and how the news can feel overwhelming and negative at times, this could help 
to change people’s outlook on what we can be appreciative. With the color of the teal like highlight and the fun but bold font, 
it catches the user’s attention quite quickly. The main goal within this project is to provide the user with a more positive 
connotation when enabling the extension. The inspiration behind the assignment came from the YAS by Queer Eye, where the 
extension invokes a feeling rather it just being solely an idea.

A list of the words I chose:
Accomplished, Accomplishment, Beneficial, Celebrated, Congratulation, Commend, Empower, Encouraging, Engaging, 
Effective, Esteemed, Excellent, Flourishing, Growth, Generous, Healthy, Honorable, Healing, Inspire, Innovative, 
Motivating, Positive, Productive, Progress, Quality, Respected, Reassuring, Rewarding, Successful, Support, Supportive, 
Truthful, Thriving, Value, Valued, Worthy, amongst a few others shown in my code.
